# contribute-foss

This project was inspired in part by Ubuntu Budgie system administrator Dustin Krysak, and began as a Forbes article entitled "8 Ways To Contribute To The Desktop Linux Community, Without Knowing A Single Line Of Code."

The article was just the beginning, however. The end goal is to create a living Wiki page with detailed ideas on how to contribute to the Linux and open source software community, regardless of skillset or experience. 

The Wiki should include exhaustive links to various "Get Involved" pages of all Linux distributions and open source software projects. 

I have no experience creating a Wiki, and this is my first GitHub project, so any and all suggestions and feedback are welcome.
